        faqs:
            'why_subscription':
                question: 'Why do I need a subscription?'
                answer: 'A brand is more than a great logo design (even though that really helps)! Tailor Brands helps make sure that you’re on the right track. <br><br>Our Logo Only plan grants you unlimited storage of all your logo files and the higher plan you purchase, the more you get for your brand and small business. Looking for different sizes, professional presentations, social media posts, or business card designs? Create your own logo, refine to your liking, choose the right plan for you, and you’ll have access to your own Brand Profile for as long as you have a subscription with Tailor! <br><b>Remember, you’ll always maintain the rights for your design even when your subscription runs out.</b>'
            'logo_without_subscription':
                question: 'Can I just buy a logo without a subscription?'
                answer: 'Your logo design is one part of your brand and we want to make it easy for you to expand, so we don’t offer any logo options outside of subscription. Our Logo Only plan offers unlimited logo storage, access to PNG and JPG file formats, and your logo on a monthly, annual, or biennial basis – all depending on the option that you choose! <br><br>If you’d like access to any of our other offerings, you can upgrade through your account. If you decide that the logo is all you’re looking for, you’re able to cancel through your Brand Profile and maintain storage for the remainder of your plan. <br><b>You retain all use rights for your design, even after your subscription has ended!</b>'
            'cancel_subscription':
                question: 'What happens if I cancel my subscription?'
                answer: 'Looking to cancel your subscription? We’ll be sad to see you go, but understand, things happen! If you cancel your subscription through your Brand Profile, you will have access to your plan and downloads through the end of your subscription period.
