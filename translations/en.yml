                question: 'Why should I use Tailor Brands?'
            upgarde_subscription:
                answer: 'Yes, you can! If you choose a smaller plan and realize that you’re missing some of the features that you like, you can always upgrade through your account. Your Brand Profile, which you’ll have access to after you design your logo, will be the place to go for this.'
                question: 'Can I upgrade my subscription after I purchase?'
            unlimited_logo_designs:
                answer: 'Not right now! Each Tailor Brands subscription is linked to one logo only. All of the assets that are included with your purchase will be based off the logo that it’s bought with, and all different designs will need their own subscription and assets. If you have any questions about it, please feel free to reach out at hello@tailorbrands.com – we’d love to help!'
                question: 'Does this include unlimited logo designs?'
            keep_rights:
                answer: 'Yes! You create your logo design, you have the rights to it. Tailor Brands is aimed at helping you maintain your brand, not to prevent you from your logo rights. If your subscription ends, you won’t be able to use Tailor Brands services or download your assets from your Brand Profile, but you can use your logo as you’d like.'
                question: 'Do I keep all the rights to my logo?'
            cancel_subscription:
                answer: 'Looking to cancel your subscription? We’ll be sad to see you go, but understand, things happen! If you cancel your subscription through your Brand Profile, you will have access to your plan and downloads through the end of your subscription period. Afterward, <b>you’ll retain the rights to your designs</b>, but you’ll be unable to create any new assets or download from your Brand Profile.'
                question: 'What happens if I cancel my subscription?'
            logo_without_subscription:
                answer: 'Your logo design is one part of your brand and we want to make it easy for you to expand, so we don’t offer any logo options outside of subscription. Our Logo Only plan offers unlimited logo storage, access to PNG and JPG file formats, and your logo on a monthly, annual, or biennial basis – all depending on the option that you choose! <br><br>If you’d like access to any of our other offerings, you can upgrade through your account. If you decide that the logo is all you’re looking for, you’re able to cancel through your Brand Profile and maintain storage for the remainder of your plan. <br><b>You retain all use rights for your design, even after your subscription has ended!</b>'
                question: 'Can I just buy a logo without a subscription?'
            why_subscription:
                answer: 'A brand is more than a great logo design (even though that really helps)! Tailor Brands helps make sure that you’re on the right track. <br><br>Our Logo Only plan grants you unlimited storage of all your logo files and the higher plan you purchase, the more you get for your brand and small business. Looking for different sizes, professional presentations, social media posts, or business card designs? Create your own logo, refine to your liking, choose the right plan for you, and you’ll have access to your own Brand Profile for as long as you have a subscription with Tailor! <br><b>Remember, you’ll always maintain the rights for your design even when your subscription runs out.</b>'
